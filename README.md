<h1>Resolutions Buddy</h1>
People make resolutions on 1st Jan every year but eventually they fail to complete the resolutions. So maybe we can make some kind of a system where people can submit their new year resolutions with their email ids, and then they'll get email reminders about their resolutions periodically, so that they will more likely end up actually completing their resolutions! And once they complete it, they can again log in to the site and just input that 'goals achieved' or something like that, so that they'll stop getting reminders.

<br>
The most common reason for participants failing their New Years' Resolutions was setting themselves unrealistic goals (35%), while 33% didn't keep track of their progress and a further 23% forgot about it. About one in 10 respondents claimed they made too many resolutions.
<br>
A 2007 study by Richard Wiseman from the University of Bristol involving 3,000 people showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail, despite the fact that 52% of the study's participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting, (a system where small measurable goals are being set; such as, a pound a week, instead of saying "lose weight").</p>
<p>
Our project will:
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>remind people of their NY resolutions to deal with those 23% who forget about it</li>
    <li>help people set measurable goals to raise these 22%</li>
    <li>keep list short: no more than 10 items are available</li>
  </ul>
